Here is complete codes of oop's in python

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python is a programming paradigm that organizes code around objects rather than functions and logic. It focuses on creating reusable, modular, and organized programs by modeling real-world entities. The core concepts of OOP in Python include:
Classes and Objects:
Class: A blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that objects of that class will possess.
Object: An instance of a class. It is a concrete entity created based on the class blueprint, with its own unique set of attribute values.
Encapsulation:
The bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit, which is the class.
It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, promoting data protection and preventing unintended modifications.
Inheritance:
A mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass or base class).
It promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.
Polymorphism:
The ability of an object to take on many forms or to be treated as an instance of different classes through a common interface.
It allows the same method name to be used for different classes, with each class implementing the method in its own specific way.
Abstraction:
The process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object to the user.
It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it, simplifying the interaction with complex systems.
